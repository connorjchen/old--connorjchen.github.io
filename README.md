# connorjchen.github.io (Old)

### Description

old--connorjchen.github.io is the repo that was originally used for my personal portfolio. However, since then, I have transitioned to a differently formatted personal portfolio. Nonetheless, I aim to keep this repo public to showcase the code I wrote to create it.
